                            Typically, credit repair companies will remove inaccurate or incomplete information from a consumer credit report, resulting in a skeletal credit profile. A skeletal credit profile is when you have a high credit score but no depth to show maturity. This results in denied credit applications. The B2C Partners network on the other hand, takes a different approach by rehabilitating a consumers credit profile with depth and a good credit mix. To highlight this distinction, the B2C partners network explains the benefits below:
